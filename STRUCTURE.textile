h1. the three parts of tree routing

h2. parsing

Done by @URI::parse@.

h2. Walker

The Walker creates a Runner and sends it through the tree. If the Runner finds
more than one path somewhere, the Walker dups the Runner and shifts it to an
Array and tires it later on if the inital one fails to find a Route. Note:
This way we don't find ambigious routes, so the walking algorithms have to
prefer more specific routes (set further left in the Array of children).

h2. calling the rack app
