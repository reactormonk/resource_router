h1. the three parts of tree routing

h2. parsing

Taking stuff from the env rack hash.

h2. Walker

The Walker creates a Runner and sends it through the tree. If the Runner finds
more than one path somewhere, the Walker dups the Runner and shifts it to an
Array and tires it later on if the inital one fails to find a Route. Note:
This way we don't find ambigious routes, that's why there is the 'priority'
in a Node. The higher the priority, the more specific the path is, the sooner
it will be walked.

h2. calling the rack app
